During the last few months I played an AI oriented RPG called Gr1d http://www.gr1d.org - this is the code that made me get to number one for most of the game until I got disapointed with the excessive human interaction of the game.

The latest version is a bit hacked as I wanted to try some algorithms on the search for new agents using width first search but the server was failing a lot and I stopped playing before cleaning up
